## Pokémon Knowledge

### Type Matchups
Pokémon battles involve a complex type matchup system. Types like **Fire**, **Water**, and **Grass** have distinct strengths and weaknesses:

- **Fire** is strong against **Grass**, but weak against **Water**.
- **Water** is strong against **Fire**, but weak against **Grass**.
- **Grass** is strong against **Water**, but weak against **Fire**.

Some types are **immune** to others:

- **Ground-type** moves do not affect **Flying-type** Pokémon.
- **Normal-type** and **Fighting-type** moves do not affect **Ghost-type** Pokémon.
- **Ghost-type** moves do not affect **Normal-type** Pokémon.

These interactions require strategic team building and move selection.

### Evolution Methods
Pokémon evolve through various methods:

- **Leveling up**: Most Pokémon evolve after reaching a certain level.
- **Friendship**: Some evolve with high friendship (e.g., Eevee → Espeon during the day, Umbreon at night).
- **Trading**: Machoke evolves into Machamp when traded.
- **Special items**: Evolution stones trigger evolutions for Pokémon like Eevee (e.g., Thunder Stone → Jolteon).
- **Location-based**: Certain Pokémon evolve only in specific locations (e.g., Magneton → Magnezone at Mt. Coronet).
- **Move-based**: Some Pokémon evolve after learning a specific move (e.g., Piloswine → Mamoswine after learning Ancient Power).

### Regional Forms
Some Pokémon have multiple regional variants, each with different types, appearances, and evolutions:

- **Meowth** has Kantonian (Normal), Alolan (Dark), and Galarian (Steel) forms.
- **Ponyta** is normally Fire-type, but Galarian Ponyta is **Psychic-type**.
- **Zigzagoon** in Hoenn is Normal-type, while Galarian Zigzagoon is Dark/Normal and evolves into Obstagoon.

Regional forms reflect the environment and culture of each game region.
