## Pokémon Knowledge

### Type Matchups

Pokémon battles involve a complex type matchup system. Types like **Fire**, **Water**, and **Grass** have distinct strengths and weaknesses:

* **Fire** is strong against **Grass**, but weak against **Water**.
* **Water** is strong against **Fire**, but weak against **Grass**.
* **Grass** is strong against **Water**, but weak against **Fire**.

Some types are **immune** to others:

* **Ground-type** moves do not affect **Flying-type** Pokémon.
* **Normal-type** and **Fighting-type** moves do not affect **Ghost-type** Pokémon.
* **Ghost-type** moves do not affect **Normal-type** Pokémon.

These interactions require strategic team building and move selection.

### Evolution Methods

Pokémon evolve through various methods:

* **Leveling up**: Most Pokémon evolve after reaching a certain level.
* **Friendship**: Some evolve with high friendship (e.g., Eevee → Espeon during the day, Umbreon at night).
* **Trading**: Machoke evolves into Machamp when traded.
* **Special items**: Evolution stones trigger evolutions for Pokémon like Eevee (e.g., Thunder Stone → Jolteon).
* **Location-based**: Certain Pokémon evolve only in specific locations (e.g., Magneton → Magnezone at Mt. Coronet).
* **Move-based**: Some Pokémon evolve after learning a specific move (e.g., Piloswine → Mamoswine after learning Ancient Power).

Some Pokémon have multiple regional variants, each with different types, appearances, and evolutions:

* **Zigzagoon** in Hoenn is Normal-type, while Galarian Zigzagoon is Dark/Normal and evolves into Obstagoon.
